<h1>Learning Journal - Code 201-Day 15 : Bronwyn</h1>

A pretty good day, especially working with the project team. The morning's lecture time did not really cover any take-away material. The presentation on javascript higher level concepts was difficult to follow and hard to take notes from. I find that when everything is done in the console, with no ability to refer back to the code that caused the response, its really difficult to follow the progression.

I liked the brief into to what will be covered in the 301 course, though it was surprising to note that they suggest some prework beyond taking 201. This seems poorly structured, since 201 is supposed to BE the prework for the next course. But it was nice to get an introduction to what will be covered.

The 301 final projects were really great! Loved seeing the outcome of what the next course will cover, although it all seemed very daunting and impressive! Excited to think I will be able to achieve that complex of a project in just a few more weeks (hopefully!)

It was good working with the project team for the afternoon. We made a lot of progress on fleshing out our idea and got some suggestions and tacit approval from the instructor to proceed. I'm definitely concerned that we've bitten off more than we can chew, as once we dug into the problem/project domain it became clear there are a lot of components for making it work. But we were all very into the idea, and working on the project domain together went really well. I'm excited to see if we can pull off the game project in just a week!

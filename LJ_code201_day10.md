<h1>Learning Journal - Code 201-Day 10 : Bronwyn</h1>

This was a somewhat blah day, neither good nor bad, and that offered the least amount of productive learning of any of the class days so far. I would have liked more time spent on Git/GitHub during the lecture, since most of what was covered was actually new and not review (since we didn't cover it in a previous class as intended, it got dropped due to running out of time which Sam may not have remembered), and there's definitely still some confusion on it as relates to working with a team and having multiple branches, forks, etc.

The pair programming as a threesome was very awkward. I felt the exercise was mostly to increase comfort levels with pair programming itself, get practice using Git/GitHub especially as relates to having multiple people working on the same project and making use of forks and branches, and possibly to share knowledge of CSS and HTML between paired students. With three it was more difficult to divide the tasks, and the resulting need for a lot more discussion of who was doing what (and especially excess discussion on what to name classes and ids!) really cut into the time allowed for actually doing the work. It was mostly awkward and not very beneficial for me, though I hope the other two did pick up some new CSS tricks during the project!  Since I had to leave early on Friday (due to an event at my business that had been on the books for months before signing up for Code 201), and still wanted to be sure that I contributed to the project, I did the wireframing and HTML structure.

The biggest lesson learned was that more than 2 people is not pair programming, it is a project team, and a project team benefits from having a team lead who can direct activities and keep the team moving forward on the goal without letting scope creep derail the project deadline and goals. In that vein, its also really challenging to keep a team moving forward when you don't have a clear idea of the team member's strengths and weaknesses. In this case there were too many project leads (or actually not enough, since there really wasn't one). I deliberately tried to not "take over" the project and direct the other two's activities, but we might have been more successful if I had. If I had been the designated team lead I probably would have dived the tasks differently from what it ended up being, and would have made different decisions on how our time was spent.

The three-person pairing also meant that even getting practice on Git/GitHub was more challenging, and I don't feel that I got much out of the assignment for it's intended goals.

All in all, it wasn't a bad day per se, but I felt it didn't really add to my body of knowledge or provide a positive experience related to programming.

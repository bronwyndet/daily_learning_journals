<h1>Learning Journal - Code 201-Day 18 : Bronwyn</h1>

Team rapport continued to be good, progress was much slower today. We spent a lot of time debugging but without much success. Some momentum was lost after the rapid progress of the day before. Nothing especially notable learned during class time regarding programming, but did get some very useful tips on use of developer tools in Chrome from a friend who is in programming that would have aided our debugging efforts earlier in the day.

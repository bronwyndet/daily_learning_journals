<h1>Learning Journal - Code 201-Day 11 : Bronwyn</h1>

Today was a much more relaxed day after the intensity of week two! The assignment for this week seems interesting, but also has a lot of new concepts that will need careful thought. I really enjoyed doing the User Stories and being encouraged to spend sufficient time breaking down the problem into pseudo-code. The more relaxed air during lab was really helpful, and I was definitely in a coding groove for much of the afternoon. It was nice helping out Keith with some things which helped solidify some concepts for us both. I liked having a step-by-step process to refer to from the pseudo-code, though by the end of the day (after some input from Sam on the initial structure of my code), its clear that doing pseudo-code is another skill that will take experience to make more useful for translating into functional code.

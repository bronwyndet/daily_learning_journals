<h1>Learning Journal - Code 201-Day 12 : Bronwyn</h1>

I really liked having the option to reconvene after lunch for additional code review. It seemed like a really useful way of structuring things that allowed for those who were struggling to get extra help as a group (making maximum use of the instructor's time), while allowing those who were feeling more confident, or were in the groove, or just wanted to work directly on their code the chance to do so. I wasn't able to make much use of the code review directly, but it did show me that the way I had my code structured was not conducive to making the last pieces of the technical requirements work.

Most of the lab this afternoon was spent refactoring my code. I actually refactored it twice (or perhaps just once in two steps!) as I initially had it separated out into all separate functions, then based on Sam's input I refactored much of it into a single funtion, but then got more input and refactored back into multiple functions. It was a lot of rewriting code this afternoon!  

I referenced both Maelle's code and Judy's code (that had been gone over by Sam during code review). I adapted a few things from Maelle's, until I realized that her code may not have successfully included one of the technical requirements. I then looked at Judy's code-reviewed code and that really helped (especially the comments that illustrated the steps that were being taken, particularly in helping to know how to separate out the different steps and what to keep together).

Once I got done refactoring the structure of my code (which was pretty time consuming), I grooved along pretty quickly on finishing up the functionality and managed to get everything working by the end of the day. Sam helping with the debugging process and verifying what was happening with my code was really useful.

Keith and Judy helped me with adding the data to the Chart.js component. I was mostly there, except I didn't initially realize that I needed to create yet two more arrays! Once Keith pointed that out, it made much more sense!

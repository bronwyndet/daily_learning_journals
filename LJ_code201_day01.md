<h1>Learning Journal - Code 201-Day 01 : Bronwyn</h1>

Made it through the first day! I was pleasantly surprised by the great mix of other students. It was nice to feel that everyone will be bringing something different to the learning experience, yet everyone seems to be there to genuinely learn to code.

I was worried beforehand about my own ability to stay focused and absorb information in a day-long format. Its been over a decade since I did anything like sit in front of a computer for an entire day, and over 20 years since I was in a learning environment. But I think I did well for the first day!

Definitely a lot of "housekeeping" and administrative information imparted today, which I wish had been a bit shorter. I would have liked to get right into coding more quickly, given that the course is so short, but I have to trust that this course has been taught enough times that this first day's format works in the context of the overall course.

The issues with Git Bash and Atom that I experienced have me worried, particularly since I am the only one who experienced significant computer setup issues. Hopefully I'll be able to continue to work around the quirk without missing vital information during the lectures, and also still get enough experience with the Terminal.

Not a bad first day, and I'm really excited about getting down to some coding tomorrow!

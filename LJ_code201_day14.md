<h1>Learning Journal - Code 201-Day 13 : Bronwyn</h1>

Today was a lot of topics! Again I really enjoyed the HTML/CSS with Brian and got a lot of good tips for structuring and using CSS. The reminder about using Reset styles, and margin: 0 auto, were really helpful. Making use of nesting versus using a lot of class names surprised me but I can understand the benefits when trying to keep everything organized.

The leveled up javascript lecture was really difficult to follow and I didn't get much in the way of takeaway information from it. It felt disorganized and not well prepared, and as it progressed I found it impossible to take notes. I'd really like to better understand prototypes and inheritance, but feel there's still alot to learn about them! It was nice to get exposure to these advanced topics, though, and am looking forward to exploring them more in the next course.

The team project went pretty well. It was good to have a low-pressure activity to start team building with. I'm still feeling shaky about GitHub collaboration and need to spend some time searching the internet for some better step by step process guides. Again, some of the lecture seemed as if it glossed over or skipped certain steps, or just weren't really clear. The diagrams are nice, but it doesn't really say what you're supposed to do.

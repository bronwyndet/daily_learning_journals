<h1>Learning Journal - Code 201-Day 08 : Bronwyn</h1>

Been a lot of hitting my head against the proverbial wall the past few afternoons. Not entirely unexpected given the intense nature of this accelerated course, but still frustrating when the 'a-ha' moments seem within hair's length of my grasp and yet remain elusive. There are some parts of the conceptual model that I seem to get almost instinctively, but some there are times when following the breadcrumbs is frustratingly beyond me (at least for now).  I can visualize the placement of things that are conceptually concrete to me, such as the event handler/event listeners, and even the prototype / inheritance concept make sense, but in the lab for the past two days there remains a piece of the logical flow that is not manifesting to me (yet!).

But despite the frustrations of not grasping some things, I need to give myself credit for the things that I DO know and HAVE LEARNED in a short time. I am usually hardest on myself, and in this intense learning environment, that is a definite handicap.  It is something I am working on, and know that I will be better for it not just in a programming career but in other aspects of my life.

So, in that vein, I am proud of the things that I have grasped. I am proud of my About_Me project, particularly all the parts of it that were things I looked up and grasped on my own. I am happy that I have been able to understand some of the more ethereal aspects of coding (such as the DOM, event handlers/event listeners, prototype inheritance, constructors) and will try not to get overly bogged down in the small things that remain elusive. I am grateful for the opportunity to be learning programming, and for the potential that I know is within me to become capable and successful in this new career path. The concepts that I have not yet gotten are within my grasp, and will come when they do. I will try to remember to have confidence in the stacked learning model and know that things will fall into place when my subconscious mind has been able to process as I layer on those things that do come more readily.

<h1>Learning Journal - Code 201-Day 05 : Bronwyn</h1>

Today was a bit of a mixed day. Class time including lab seemed to go well, and I thought I had a good handle on things (especially after Sam's hints that confirmed the solutions that I had worked out), but once I got home and went to finish up, I discovered I had missed a critical component explanation for calculating daily cookies sales as well as how to render. The rendering part of the lecture was rushed earlier in the day and I knew I'd missed some of it due to browser/console issues, but I thought Sam had said he would be going over it more thoroughly on Tuesday, but he later said he would not be going over it again as he'd already done so during the lecture. Unfortunately I'm not understanding the pieces of the rendering puzzle.

This evening working at home has been a disheartening experience and I'm feeling like I have fallen behind the rest of the students. I think I get the basic concepts, but putting them into practice writing code has been a moment of hitting the wall as far as progress. I'm not getting it, and the code is starting to blur to my vision, so I am leaving it for now and hoping that fresh eyes, more sleep, and maybe some help from instructors will help clarify whatever it is that I missed.

Not feeling very optimistic about my ability to grasp all that is being thrown at us this week!

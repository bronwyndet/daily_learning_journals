<h1>Learning Journal - Code 201-Day 16 : Bronwyn</h1>

Today we went straight into project groups instead of any lecture time. The team reviewed what we'd done on Sunday with the team member who had been unavailable on the weekend, we further developed a step by step breakdown of the functionality needed for the code, and then we broke into a programming pair of myself and Keith to begin working on the coding portion while Jon set up the repo and the initial files. Once the repo was completed we cloned the initial project files and each started our own working branches.  Although we had a piece of the code working, there was still some confusion about the best way to accomplish the game (as its clear there are many many ways to do it), and rather than leaving some team members idle, we switched partners and I did more HTML scaffolding and set up some basic CSS styling (i.e, set up the navigation, loaded the fonts, set up the basic grid elements, added our color scheme, etc.).

We initially picked a part of the functionality we knew would be challenging, and I wrote a code snippet  using some 'assumed' variables (variables that would come through randomizing and breaking up a string into individual character strings, but we didn't do that part of the code, just plugged in a single character to begin with), tested it, and it worked. Huzzah!

However, not long after achieving that, we agreed to really dig in on the project work (vs. project planning), but we did not really discuss the project roles and it became challenging to move things forward without any clear accountability or process deadlines.

Although I periodically asked my team members how they were progressing, it was clear that not much was happening on the functionality.  We found a well developed example game to use as a launch point, but it contained a lot of code that was unfamiliar.  We agreed to spend some time trying to reverse engineer that game, but toward the end of the day it turned out that the team member who had taken the unofficial lead on doing the day's javascript coding had abandoned that example without discussing it with the rest of the team. He then spent a lot of time on his own and with an instructor coming up with a function to accomplish the same thing that had been achieved with the code snipped first thing that morning.

Since none of us quite know how to accomplish the different features of the game, its hard to direct the coding in a meaningful way. There are very different skill and comfort levels with JS, and we all absorb new material at very different rates and in very different manners. There was definitely some tension building by the end of the day when it was clear that not only was there no progress on the javascript, but we also still had no idea how to accomplish the game. The team needs a clear direction to pursue, but throughout the day the team member who was most focused on the javascript did not clearly communicate what he was doing for the day.

At the end of the day we agreed to all spend time in the evening looking at the example we found and tryign to come up with some more concrete ideas on how to achieve the functionality. Hopefully when we reconvene in the morning we will be able to settle on a particular path forward and see some results.

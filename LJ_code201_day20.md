<h1>Learning Journal - Code 201-Day 20 : Bronwyn</h1>

Final morning working on the Totally Rad Hangman game. We fixed the final bug in refreshing/persisting the high score with the initials at the almost 11th hour and then did the presentation. Good reminder that stepping away from code, taking a break from things that aren't working, and getting valuable rest can really pay off. The presentation went well and the team was really happy with the final game product, the presentation, and the overall team. Goals accomplished, assignment completed, teammates friends. A good day.

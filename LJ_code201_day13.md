<h1>Learning Journal - Code 201-Day 13 : Bronwyn</h1>

Today did not have quite the same level of intensity of learning that some previous days have had. I really enjoyed the HTML/CSS portion with Brian and am finding his lecture style (at least on this topic) to be really easy to follow. I've been surprised at how much I like the HTML and CSS portion (since I didn't take to it very well years ago when I dabbled in it). I'm excited to see the next half of his lecture on adding the CSS to our HTML structure.

I've noticed that during lectures where we're going back and forth between code and console, we switch to console so quickly that I haven't had a chance to see what the code was that resulted in the console behaviour. In trying to rush through writing notes and paying attention to what was happening, I apparently wrote the method for retrieving stored data incorrectly. Thankfully I got it corrected during lab.

Was sent down the rabbit hole again this afternoon, after initially having the main chunk of new functionality working. Spent a lot of time getting something to work that wasn't going to be useful but at least I got it working (and it was way harder than what I actually needed to have done, and had done originally). Once I figured out that I had been sent down the rabbit hole again, I managed to figure out how to make use of what I'd already done (initially I thought I might have to revert to the code I started the lab with), and I did get the functionality working by the very end of class -- it took about 25 minutes including doing the new barchart. The day was a lot of time spent not as I would have liked, I'm well behind most of the rest of the class now, but hopefully can catch up tomorrow.

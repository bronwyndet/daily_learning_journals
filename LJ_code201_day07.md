<h1>Learning Journal - Code 201-Day 07 : Bronwyn</h1>

Another bit of a rough day (though somewhat reassuring to know that it is a common reaction to Day 07 and week 2 of the course!). Starting out behind on the week's lab project today made for a rough afternoon. But I was really glad that the lecture went over how to "render" since I had not really been able to absorb it on Monday. Lots of inexplicable overwhelming emotion today; there were tears, embarrassingly so, but there it is. Its an overwhelming experience in many ways, and the anxiety over "will it [the impact to my daughter, myself, and my business] be worth it" has been an especially intrusive worry the past two days.

I found walking myself through the lines of code really helpful. Whether on my own or in tandem with an instructr/TA, being able to talk out and visualize what each line of code was doing was a big part of increasing comprehension for the day. It took several iterations of the table rendering function, but I did begin to understand the syntax by the end of the day! There was a vital piece of the puzzle that I didn't really clue into until the end of the day, that in the append method its what goes into the () that is the child. It was there in front of me the whole day, but until Sam actually SAID it, I was constantly confused as to which variable name went where. But I got it in the end, and now I know!

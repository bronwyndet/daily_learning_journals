<h1>Learning Journal - Code 201-Day 09 : Bronwyn</h1>

Today was a stark contrast to the previous few days, gratefully a much more positive day! After hitting my head against the wall on one aspect or another of the code functionality all week, the code review in the morning revealed that I was actually even closer than I had realized. Turned out it needed the deletion of one line of code (I had the event listener pushing the new store into the location array, missing the fact that the constructor function did that already thus creating duplicate stores), and the addition of one line of code (to clear the table so it would not produce a second table).  I could have struggled with this for longer (though I was on the right track of what needed to be fixed even before the code review), but the code review produced that 'a-ha' moment (with a side of 'duh') that  reinvigorated my confidence and cemented the learning (since I tend to learn by seeing the solution and reverse engineering it in my head so that I can picture the pathway).

I made use of Britt's solution for the totals row by dissecting it, writing it out in my own pseudo code, then typing out the code from my pseudo code and using Britt's as a comparison to really cement what it was doing. By doing it that was I was able to visualize what the double for loops were really doing. It also reinforced the importance of (and challenge of!) variable naming ... the for loops were densely packed with numerous variables that were all pretty similar in name and it made tracing what was happening harder than it maybe should have been. I made ample use of Atom's feature of highlighting all instances of the same words to help track the variables and what they were doing.

Once through all that, at Sam's urging, I tacked the Stretch Goal of having the form replace an existing store with new data. Although he thought I could whip through it in 10-15 minutes, it actually took over an hour. The construction of the comparison and the methods for doing alternate actions was easy, but I got hung up on how to push the new variables into the existing array. Turns out I was trying to replace only some of the variables (which I am sure there is a way to do, and that was what I was trying to figure out unsuccessfully), but with Maelle's help I figured out that I needed to push in not only the new variables but also the static existing variables. I had an extra step for determining true or false which she suggested wasn't necessary (thus applying DRY), and after implementing her suggestion for pushing the data and verifying that it worked, I then applied DRY to her solution within my own code and pushed a new array incorporating both the new data and the existing static data, rather than pushing the individual data points separately.

Once home I whipped out some HTML and CSS without much difficultly. It was a good day to reinvigorate my learning, my confidence, and my excitement for this opportunity.

The past few days have really exemplified things I already knew (such as my learning style, and how I best retain new information), as well as what I know I need to continue to work on (such as not beating myself up so much for not getting things quickly).

I'm very grateful that we had Thursday to relax, take the urgent pressure off, take stock of our progress, and make solid headway on cementing our new skills and knowledge. It was a vital day for moving forward. Huzzah!

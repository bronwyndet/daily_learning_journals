<h1>Learning Journal - Code 201-Day 19 : Bronwyn</h1>

Today was spent trying to work out bugs in the otherwise mostly completed project code. Team continued to work well together even while working on elusive fixes for the high score and local storage issues. We tried lots of different things, eventually got some input from an instructor, dealt with a github issue that took almost an hour to resolve. A long day, but in the end we realized that sleep and fresh eyes were going to be more effective than continuing to work on the same problem so we called it a night with just one bug remaining to work out.

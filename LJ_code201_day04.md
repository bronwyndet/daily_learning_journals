<h1>Learning Journal - Code 201-Day 04 : Bronwyn</h1>

Today was pretty easy compared to yesterday's loop frustrations! If felt almost like a team building day, and I did better with the Pair Programming than I would have expected. Being the "driver" and not being able to touch the keyboard was an interesting exercise! Since I'm more of a kinetic learner, it was hard to not be doing the typing ... but it gave me a good experience of talking things through with someone else, which is going to be a necessary skill in the coding workforce.

Overall today went pretty well, and I did learn some new things. The += shortcut:
  var zamble +=     shortcut
  var zamble = var zamble + 1    longhand

I wish I hadn't been interrupted with urgent Wayward text messages during the GitHub part of the lecture (pull request), but managed to stumble through it just by reading the instructions and watching for the buttons and directions on GitHub itself.

I'm excited to play around with some more CSS in the coming days! I also really want to do some more adjustments to my JavaScript questions (getting them to print out to the guessinggame page).

Not as much specific learning today, but good cementing of existing skills (such as reinforcing git a-c-p, writing out functions, working collaboratively).

A good day.

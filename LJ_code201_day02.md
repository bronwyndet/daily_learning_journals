<h1>Learning Journal - Code 201-Day 02 : Bronwyn</h1>

Hooray for coding!  It was great to start doing lab time today. It's one of the aspects of the course that I've been worried about, given how long its been since I was in a collaborative or learning environment. But it went far better than I expected. Riffing off of the excitement and interest of the other students was incredibly inspiring. I had the opportunity to help answer questions, provide encouragement, and learn from others.

I actually liked developing the CSS and HTML files more than I expected. Although creating the content was a bit  painful, once I started approaching it from the perspective of an opportunity to explore and experiment with CSS, it went much better. I had to shift my approach and recognize that the assignment was not just about JS, but about practicing with all three programming components. I had a lot of fun playing with CSS selectors, declarations, properties, and values.

With the JS I learned a succession of ways to accomplish the same thing, and it really exemplified the reality that there are always going to be multiple ways to accomplish the same thing (in programming). I didn't fully appreciate that before today, as I was under the misguided impression that programming was more static and constrained. However, while there are multiple ways to accomplish something, it also seemed to be readily apparent when a different script improved upon its predecessor.

Example:

this works ...

var answerTwo = prompt('Does Bronwyn have a daughter?');
if (answerTwo.toLowerCase() === 'yes' || answerTwo.toLowerCase() === 'y')

but this is more streamlined ...

var answerTwo = prompt('Does Bronwyn have a daughter?').toLowerCase;
if (answerTwo === 'yes' || answerTwo === 'y')
